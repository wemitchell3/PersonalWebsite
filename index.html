          Having spent much of my career in selling enterprise hardware and
          software solutions as a Data Center Solutions Architect for Dell
          Inc. and running my own e-commerce business, I always had a yearning
          to learn more about coding and wasn't sure of the best way to get
          started. I was introduced to the Nashville Software School and
          everything fell into place! I am on the right path and excited to
          see where this next chapter takes me as a Software Engineer.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">ReactJS Mobile Web App</div>
            <p>
              LugNutz is designed to be a mobile web app to help users
              keep track of their vehicle’s maintenance and repair logs. The
              inspiration for this app came to me after many years of helping
              family and friends solve their vehicle repair problems and not
              having an easy way to keep track of what they and/or I had done
              to their vehicle over the years. LugNutz allows users
              to add all vehicles they are in charge of maintaining and add
              all previous and future maintenance/repair tasks. There is also
              a chat forum to allow users to share ideas and help each other
              diagnose and solve repair issues. LugNutz was built
              using React, ReactStrap | BootStrap 4, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
              Firebase, & JSON.

            <p>
              After building LugNutz for my front-end capstone and spending
              the second half of my time at NSS learning the fundamentals of
              C#, MVC, .NET Core, Entity Framework, and SQL technologies, I determined
              there was much more I could add to LugNutz, so I decided to create LugNutz 2.0, premium edition.
            </p>
            <p>
              LugNutz Premium is primarily designed to be a Desktop Web
              Application, geared towards garage warriors and part-time
              mechanics. Additional functionality includes
              automatic vehicle creation using the Vehicle Identification
              Number to fetch vehicle specifications through the National
              Highway Traffic Safety Administration API and vehicle specific VIN decoded reports.
            </p>

        <p>
          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber.
          During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking,
          free climbing, and kayaking.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a
          large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
          advancements in the front-end web development world.
